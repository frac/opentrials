zc.buildout
-----------

This package helps on the deploy process, because installs depended packages on their required
versions. Helps also to find good solutions for tests, continuous integration and others.

Before all you must install the script "raminelrecipe" from::

    git clone git://github.com/marinho/raminel-recipe.git
    cd raminel-recipe
    sudo python setup.py install

"raminelrecipe" is just an extension of "djangorecipe" that changes the way of set the project
'settings' module, ignoring the project name (instead of set it, on original version), because
some projects do not use the project as the root module.

After that::

    python bootstrap.py
    ./bin/buildout

.. note::
    We used the recipe "djangorecipe" to help on Django's projeto deploy. So, to run management
    commands, you have to replace the old ``python manage.py`` for ``./bin/django/``.
    
    Examples: ./bin/django migrate; ./bin/django runserver

    There is also a WSGI script automatically created in ./bin/ directory that should be used
    by Apache or Lighttpd (or another web server).
