This is a copy of django-registration changeset d36a38202ee3 [1]

It was obtained doing wget on URL [2] on 2010-03-23

From the zip above the registration/ subdir was extracted and this readme added.

Previously I tried to do a regular install but successive import errors trying 
to use the default backend convinced me that the documented installation 
procedure does not work at this time. (LR)
