        <study_design>
	    Thirty-two clinically stable preterm infants weighing &lt; 2500
	    grams, with no significant perinatal asphyxia, were allocated to
	    two groups: a control group (CG) in which no intervention was made
	    (n=16) and a study group (SG) in which the newborn infants received
	    tactile and kinesthetic stimulation (n=16). Data on the infants’
	    clinical progress were collected from medical charts and behavioral
	    evaluations were carried out using a series of weekly, 8-minute
	    films recorded from study admission until hospital discharge.
	</study_design>
    </study_type>
    <outcomes>
	<primary_outcome>
	    Predominance of self-regulated behavior in Behavioral Scale
	    (adapted from Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale NBAS).
	    Timepoint: every week, at least one week after beggining of
	    stimulation until hospital discharge.
